#CSCI E-15, Project 4, the grand finale

##Final Project
###Objectives

There is no better way for me to explain this, so I will list the requirements:

This project is open-ended. Whatever you create, the main expectation is that the project meets the following criteria:
Uses PHP/Laravel.
Uses a database with at least 2 tables. This count does not include a users table, but does include pivot tables.
Demonstrates all 4 CRUD interactions (user signup/login does not count towards this).
Demonstrates server-side error validation.
If you started this course at a more advanced level and your confidence in the material is high, you are encouraged to create an application of your choosing.

##What I Made
I made a tacking system for games that you own, you can add, read, update, and delete games. You can also track gaming session that you play with dynamically update games from the database.
